Deep Learning for Automated Threat Detection for Airport X-ray Baggage Screening

X-ray security screening plays a crucial role for ensuring public safety and preventing potential threats. The process of manually searching and visually identifying prohibited objects in X-ray images is time-consuming and prone to human errors. To fill this void and improve the efficiency of this process, We investigate object detection algorithms based on deep learning to find and categorize prohibited items in X-ray pictures. Specifically, we aim to detect the presence of Guns, Knives,
Wrenches, Pliers, and Scissors in the images using Object Detection models. We evaluate the performance of basic Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster-RCNN), You Only Look Once (YOLO), (YOLOv5 & YOLOv7) on the Sixray dataset. Our study provides insights into the effectiveness of Object Detection models for detecting prohibited objects in X-ray images and highlights the importance of using deep learning techniques for
improving security inspection processes. This is done as a part of the course work in master's degree.
