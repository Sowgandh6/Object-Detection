Deep Learning for Automated Threat Detection for Airport X-ray Baggage Screening

X-ray security screening plays a crucial role for en-
suring public safety and preventing potential threats. The pro-
cess of manually searching and visually identifying prohibited
objects in X-ray images is time-consuming and prone to human
errors. To fill this void and improve the efficiency of this process,
We investigate object detection algorithms based on deep learn-
ing to find and categorize prohibited items in X-ray pictures.
Specifically, we aim to detect the presence of Guns, Knives,
Wrenches, Pliers, and Scissors in the images using Object De-
tection models. We evaluate the performance of basic Convo-
lutional Neural Networks (CNN), Faster Region-based Convo-
lutional Neural Networks (Faster-RCNN), You Only Look Once
(YOLO), YOLOv5, and YOLOv7 on the Sixray dataset. Our
study provides insights into the effectiveness of Object Detec-
tion models for detecting prohibited objects in X-ray images and
highlights the importance of using deep learning techniques for
improving security inspection processes. This is done as a part of course work in master's.
